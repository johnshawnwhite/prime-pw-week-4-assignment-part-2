    <!---Noticed most of th way through that I used the header
     for my "my nmae is your name" location
    decided to use it on purpose.****UPDATE: i have went back back
    fixed it, although would it have been an issue?-->

    <div class='info'>
      <h2>
        My name is SHAWN
      </h2>

    <div class='h3'>
      <h3>2005 Nissan Altima Se-R, Nothing special
      It's a fun car!
      </h3>

<!-- I see how i missed the header tag, I was just thinking about giving it its own properties i think.
Not sure how i missed the color change parts of this assignment. Your right
I will have to do a better job checking my work.
Thanks for the feedback.
